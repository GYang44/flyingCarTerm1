# ## Heuristics
# The heuristic function determines the $h()$ value for each cell based on the goal cell and the method chosen to determine it. The heuristic value can be the Euclidean distance between these cells $h= \left((x_i-x_{goal})^2+(y_i-y_{goal})^2\right)^{1/2}$ or the "Manhattan distance", which is the minimum number of moves required to reach the goal from the assigned cell $h = ||x_i-x_{goal}|| + ||y_i-y_{goal}||$. For this exercise you could use either, or something else which is *admissible* and *consistent*.



# TODO: implement a heuristic function. This may be one of the
# functions described above or feel free to think of something
# else.

    h = ((position[0] - goal_position[0])**2 + (position[1] - goal_position[1])**2)**0.5

# ## A* search
#
# A* search is an extension of the cost search you implemented. A heuristic function is used in addition to the cost penalty. Thus if the setup is:
#
# * $c$ is the current cost
# * $g$ is the cost function
# * $h$ is the heuristic function
#
# Then the new cost is $c_{new} = c + g() + h()$.
#
# The difference between $g$ and $h$ is that $g$ models the cost of performing actions, irrespective of the environment, while $h$ models the cost based on the environment, i.e., the distance to the goal.
